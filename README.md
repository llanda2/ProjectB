## Thesis Statement
This data visualization project explores the relationship between fossil fuel usage, renewable energy consumption, birth rates, and under-5 mortality rates. By analyzing these indicators across different countries, this visualization aims to highlight patterns and trends that could inform better policy decisions for sustainable development, with a specific focus on improving public health outcomes.

## Context for Your Data Visualization
This dashboard is designed to facilitate exploration of global energy consumption trends and their potential effects on public health, particularly focusing on birth rates and child mortality. The target audience for this visualization includes policy makers, environmentalists, and the general public interested in understanding how energy practices impact societal well-being. By presenting the data interactively, users can select different countries or regions and observe how their energy consumption patterns correlate with health indicators.

The story will be told by visually emphasizing the interconnections between these indicators, providing insights into how sustainability and public health are intertwined.

### Context Behind Choosing the Indicators:
My interest in this project stems from articles and videos I’ve encountered discussing the ongoing decline in birth rates in many countries. A common concern raised is that this trend could lead to the collapse of societies or cause an overwhelming caretaking burden due to aging populations. Some research has even suggested a link between declining birth rates and fossil fuel consumption. Specifically, studies indicate that the widespread use of fossil fuels during industrialization could be contributing to falling fertility levels. This could be due to pollution from burning fossil fuels, which might affect reproductive health.

Key points about this connection include:
- **Correlation with Industrialization**: Research suggests that birth rates began to decline around the same time as the widespread adoption of fossil fuels and industrialization.
- **Pollution Exposure**: There are concerns about exposure to harmful chemicals released from burning fossil fuels, which may impact fertility rates.
- **Early Gestation Sensitivity**: Some studies highlight that early pregnancy may be particularly vulnerable to these chemicals, further emphasizing the potential reproductive health risks associated with fossil fuel consumption.

These connections raise important questions about how environmental factors, especially fossil fuel usage, could be influencing fertility and, ultimately, societal sustainability. The datasets chosen for this project reflect these concerns, aiming to explore the potential relationships between energy practices and public health outcomes.

## Brief Description of Datasets and Why You Selected Them
The datasets used in this project come from the World Bank, and they include the following indicators:

1. **SP.DYN.CBRT.IN** – Birth rate, crude (per 1,000 people)
2. **EG.USE.COMM.FO.ZS** – Fossil fuel energy consumption (% of total)
3. **EG.FEC.RNEW.ZS** – Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption)
4. **SH.DYN.MORT** – Mortality rate, under-5 (per 1,000 live births)

These datasets were selected because they provide a global perspective on crucial social and environmental issues. Birth rates and child mortality are key indicators of public health, while energy consumption data is essential for understanding environmental sustainability. By combining these datasets, I aim to shed light on how energy practices affect public health outcomes.

## Clearly Articulated Context (SwD Ch. 1-7)
- **Who**: The audience includes environmental scientists, policy makers, researchers, and the general public interested in understanding global sustainability practices and their impact on public health.
- **What**: The action involves exploring how fossil fuel and renewable energy consumption affect birth rates and under-5 mortality. The mechanism is an interactive dashboard that allows users to filter and analyze the data. The tone is informative and data-driven, emphasizing the importance of sustainable energy practices for improving health outcomes.
- **How**: I will employ strategies from *Storytelling with Data* (SwD), such as:
  - Creating a clear structure to guide the user through the exploration of the data.
  - Using visual elements like choropleth maps and line charts to communicate complex relationships in an easy-to-understand way.
  - Providing detailed statistics upon interaction to allow for deeper exploration of trends and patterns.

## Specific Strategies from SwD
- **Pre-attentive attributes**: Using color and size to quickly convey critical information about the relationships between energy consumption and health outcomes.
- **Contextualizing data**: Providing contextual information about how the data connects to real-world problems, such as the impact of renewable energy on public health.
- **Minimizing cognitive load**: Ensuring that the dashboard is intuitive, with interactive filters that allow users to explore the data without feeling overwhelmed.
- **Narrative flow**: Presenting the data in a way that tells a cohesive story, starting with global patterns and drilling down into specific country data for more granular insights.
